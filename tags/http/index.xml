      <description>Summary Recently I was working on a project that integrated with some internal and external APIs using HTTP requests. You probably have heard about or worked with the requests library in Python which is probably the de-facto HTTP client package which is much easier to work with compared to the built-in HTTP module of Python.
The previous implementation in our project was using the requests library and for each new request it did something like requests.</description>
